# Portfolio-Project---Creating-a-Database

Welcome to my movie database project! ðŸŽ¬

In this project, I have created a comprehensive movie database that contains information about various movies, actors, reviews, and more. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly and organized collection of data related to movies and their associated details.

To achieve this, I have designed a relational database using SQL, with tables such as 'Movies', 'Actors', 'Reviews', and 'MovieActors'. The 'Movies' table stores essential information about each movie, including its title, release date, genre, box office revenue, rating, critic review score, production budget, director, and description. The 'Actors' table, on the other hand, keeps track of details about the actors, such as their names, birthdates, and nationalities.

To establish relationships between movies and actors, I have created the 'MovieActors' table. This table acts as a bridge between the 'Movies' and 'Actors' tables, allowing for a many-to-many relationship. Each entry in the 'MovieActors' table represents an actor's involvement in a particular movie.

Additionally, I have included the 'Reviews' table to capture reviews provided by users. This table stores information such as the reviewer's name, the review date, the rating given, and the actual review text. This enables users to share their thoughts and opinions about the movies in the database.

To provide a visual representation of the database structure, I have included a diagram that depicts the relationships between the tables. This diagram helps in understanding the connections and dependencies within the database schema.

Furthermore, I have provided CSV files for each table, which contain the sample data used in this project. These files can be imported into a database management system of your choice, allowing you to explore and analyze the data at your convenience.

Lastly, I have included an Excel visualization that presents an overview of all the tables, making it easy to browse through the data and gain insights.

Feel free to explore the files and leverage the database to discover interesting information about movies, actors, and reviews. Enjoy your journey through the fascinating world of cinema with this movie database project!
